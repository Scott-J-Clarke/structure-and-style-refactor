# structure-and-style-refactor

## Description

This is a website homepage made with HTML and CSS. 

I refactored the code to better understand how to:

- style HTML with CSS
- write my own comments
- use semantic HTML elements
- utilize alt tags for accessibility

This project was written over several days with the help of some classmates.
